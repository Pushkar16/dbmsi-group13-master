Database Management System Implementation Project
This involves implementations of relational calculus operations like joins and querying path expressions on the graph database. There are three primary functionalities implemented in this phase. Firstly, ensuring that the database files are persistent. Secondly, various Join operations on node heap file and edge heap file on different conditions as described in the problem specification document. Thirdly, an interface that allows querying the database using path expression queries and triangle queries.
